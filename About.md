# What we will learn
- How to use VScode with AI tools
- When not to get blocked by AI tools
-- It can make mistakes so you still need to review the code
-- Sometimes you have to get the logic working
-- Don't expect it to write 100% of the code. You still have to do a 5% lifting at a minimum.


This can help you improve code quality, speed up development, and learn new techniques. But it's not a replacement for understanding the code you write.
So, don't rely on it for everything. Use it as a tool to assist you, not as a crutch.
